Supermarket chain Good Seed is introducing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photofixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
Analyze purchases and offer products that may interest buyers in particular age groups
Monitor clerks selling alcohol
Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. To help, you'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.
Project Instructions
